Committing the first version of script used to get WCM trace data for HRRG. See README_scriptguide.txt for instructions on how to use the script. I went through the conditioning logs in Feb 2019, starting from 7th Feb 2019 and ran this script in each day's work folder to harvest the WCM trace data.
