THIS IS NOT AN EVOLUTION OF THE PREVIOUS VERSION.
This is the exact set of files used for doing the laser virtual cathode scans  which were performed on the Thu 14-Mar-19 08:41 log #846. The script was modified on the day to take averages of quantities rather than instantaneous values. The GUI is simply with no logging message window and very little information.
