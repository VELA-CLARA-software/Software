TEMPLATE PACKAGE FOR A GENERAL GUI FOR A APP WITH BASIC ELEMENTS AND THREADING. 

-For python 3 and pyqt5
-tested on DDAST0036, C:\Users\fj38\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36\python.exe main.py

The basic elements include:
-a gui which BOTH displays output from the underlying application AND takes input from the GUI to set the application parameters. 
-the output is both text and graph data
-the input is in spin boxes. 

Hopefully now using this simple template, you can adapt to virutally any kind of application requiring input and output, and it will be threaded.
