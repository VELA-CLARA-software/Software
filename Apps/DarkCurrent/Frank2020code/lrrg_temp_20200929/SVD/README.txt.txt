For the Github repository I removed the data in this directory because it was big (over 2 GB) 

The data is retained at \\fed.cclrc.ac.uk\Org\NLab\ASTeC\Projects\VELA\Software\DarkCurrent\WCM measurement\lrrg_temp_20200929\SVD

I modified the code at some point so that the SVD data got saved in the VELA work directories after a certain point in Oct/Nov 2020 anyway.
