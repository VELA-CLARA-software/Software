need to clean up logic and functions in main loop
graph updating ? is it time consuming
when to reset the mask?
create a look up table of pulse count vs power(fast??)
use the above table to index current power and increment / decrement on events

logger has print, write to event log, then send as signal to gui
look up table for power / pulse held in data and data gives next step for up or down, and has current index
have to think about what to do with kly-pwr_v_amp when we move down in power, delete data ?
kly_fwd_power should use means,apart from the data we are fitting ? and replace lots of points with mean 
last_10^6_log add lastest pulse count, breakdowns to end and remove out of date pulse counts form start
then update breakdown rate and breakdownrate-HI

MAKE SURE THAT twin vac and dc events don't add two breakdowns

only increase breakdown when not in cooldown
