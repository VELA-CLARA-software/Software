Data saving does not work, it works in llrf_test.py!!
need to clean up logic and functions in main loop
need to check the set mask function in c++ controller
make a monitor base to hide crap
make an enum for different responses, good, bad, still, bad, new bad, new-good, etc
monitor should have simple function to check states
graph updating ? is it time consuming
when to reset the mask?
Is there a single EPICS parameter that says we can get RF power (intelrocs, llrf, mod etc ?)
