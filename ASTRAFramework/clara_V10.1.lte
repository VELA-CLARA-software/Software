!Changelog:
!
!V1.1
! 09/08/2011:	First version
! 04/10/2011:	Transverse matching
! 06/01/2012:	BRANCH - replace short linac with long, BC1 corresp higher E
! 11/01/2012:	BRANCH - replace short linac with long, original BC1 E
! 23/04/2012: 	Used Sz5um10mm.sdds in RFCW element - confirmed identical,
! 		added Sx5um10mm.sdds also
! 23/04/2012:	BRANCH - add X-band fourth harmonic cavity for linearisation. 
! 		X-band is 5pi/6 72cells =0.75 m
! 25/05/2012:	BRANCH - found whole list of errors when compared with astra
! 25/05/2012:	Switched on phase_reference, compared to previous. This makes a
!		large difference, switched off again for now
! 25/05/2012:	Used SRS body focusing (note this is for pi-mode only),
!		compared to previous. This makes a small difference, switched
!		off again for now
! 25/05/2012: 	Try defining not cells but cavity (because TWLA is defined 
!		as a full cavity structure) - compare pi-mode and 
!		2pi/3-mode 
! 25/07/2012:	On Michaels recommendation use a single RFCW element, 
!		but specify cell_length and n_kicks=n_cells. elegant will apply
!		wakes at end of each kick. There is there is no need to use an
! 		RFCW for each single cell.
!		Just as well really because phase_reference doesn't work!
!		(elegent 24.1.3) produces an oscillating energy with period 3
!		cells.
!		There is a slight difference in the longitudinal phase space,
!		but i'm not going to worry too much
!		Put SRS back in now.
!
!V2.1
! 21/08/2012:	Altering long linac sections to 4.3m (122 cells) and X-band 
!		to 72 cells as per the 
!		swissfel structures. Duplicating to make the first section RFCW
!		and TWLA for comparison of wakes vs solenoids, and to check
!		consistancy.
!
!V3.1
! long pulse tuning
! 11/02/2013:	Inserted Low and High energy diagnostics lines, spectrometer 
! 		lines and cathode-to-end linac 1 sections.
!		Inserted apertures, screens, h/v correctors (mostly in quads)
!		bpms. matching is correct for RFCW focusing
!
!V4.1
! long pulse tuning
! 20/03/2013:	Inserted dogleg, modulator, radiators, fel after burner 
! 		and dump. 
!		Reduced length of CLA-S03 by removing 2 quads, 2 drifts
!		and rematching.
!		Matching is correct for RFCW focusing to the dogleg ONLY
!		Match includes undulator focusing for modulator k = 5 and radiator k = 1.25
!		Undulator focusing in mad is constructed keeping
!		the correct radiation integrals (see notebook)
!

! 31/07/2013:	Correct flange to flange swissfel linac lengths to 4.15m		
! 		LIN2, LIN3, LIN4 are 122 cells of 0.033333m = 4.06666m
!		Two end drifts are inserted of length 0.0416666 to make up to 4.15 m
! 11/09/2013:	Altered CLA-S02 to match correctly to CLARA to EBT dogleg. Inserted 2 quads 
! 		and moved all.
!  		Added C2V dogleg as part of CLA-S02SPEC. Distance to Linac 2 unchanged.
!		Also added CLA-S02-DIA-SCR-03

!		  
!		
!		Position of CLA-S02-MAG-QUAD-05 has been swapped with 
!		CLA-S02-DIA-SCR-03, to avoid CLA-S02-MAG-QUAD-05 
!		colliding with CLA-S02-CLA-S02SPEC-DIP-01 (Problem may still exist)
!
!		NEW LINE: C2V line added which contains a dipole which leads to what 
!		will be EBT

! 07/10/2014: 	Discussion with Barry to locate 2.7 mm error in above drawing. 
! 		Checked Danfysik engineering drawing of C2V dipoles. Primary dimension used is bend 
!		radius = 509.3 mm. Implies that path length in dipoles is 400.0033 mm.
!		CHANGED path lengths in lattice to reflect this		
! 09/10/2014:	Updated injector bunch to 250-MC-08
! 		(Previous bunch used 250-MC-05,
!		{bx,ax,by,ay}={0.961326, -1.03701, 1.11184, -1.18067}
!		Obtained from 020.0348.001 (JWM))
!
!V9
! 24/03/2015:	Moved S02 corrector from after collimator to before Q1 and shift
! 		rest of line downstream
! 		Insert corrector between CLA-S02-MAG-QUAD-05 and CLA-S02-DIA-SCR-03  		 
! 24/04/2015:	Altering S03: Shortening laser heater dipoles and drifts between to
! 		make space to insert 
!  		additional quadrupoles to produce a round beam at the center of the laser heater 
! 		undulator and match out
! 22/07/2015:	ASTRA input changed, lengths in ASTRA now accurate. ASTRA version
! 		used is 2June_2015.
! 		ASTRA Wakefields included
!		previous bunch was 250-MC-08 but incorrect positions of elements and end
!		ISSUE: Optics within LACVITY in MAD, and RFCW, TWLA in elegant
!		cannot be split, this has led to unrealised waists in the beam sizes
!		within the linacs - revealed by ASTRA
! 21/10/2015: 	Revised BAM design in S02 "We have settled on a 80mm 
! 		length of BAM (flange to flange) 
!  		symmetric so that the actual BAM pickup vanes are at  3650.45mm from source. 
!		This is ~ 4mm upstream  from previous assumed pickup centre 
!		(at 3705.52  less 50 = 3655.52)"
!		Reference email from Barry Fell 07/10/2015
! 21/10/2015:	Move L03 to directly after L02
! 29/10/2015:	Danfysik have made a mistake in their drawings of clara front end quad
! 		type 1 = S02 quads.
!		They are 100.7mm in length rather than the 100.0mm quoted in the drawings.
!		Corrected in lattice. Reference email from Barry Fell dated 28/10/2015
! 10/11/2015:	Moved L03, renamed all upstream, inserted short straight between L02 and L03
! 10/11/2015:	Implemented revised FEL section with 2 modulators and 17 short radiators with
! 		delay chicanes 
! 01/12/2015:	Corrector move referred to above at 24/03/2015 was not implemented in the as built
! 		girders. Additional corrector between S02-QUAD-05 and S02-SCR-03 was not ordered.
!		This was a mistake on my part (PHW). Decision was communicated to me on 31/03/2015
!		- see email in reference folder "decisions in clara design meeting 31/03/2015"
!		This means there are only two correctors ordered for S02. BF suggested
!		investigating retro-fitting an extra one over the flange between L01
!		and the following vacuum port prior toCLA-S02-MAG-QUAD-01.
!		Action taken:
!		In this lattice we keep all correctors, but match the length of the
!		first one to the space where the vacuum port is pending.
!		This will make plain the AP group intention to retro-fit
!		enabling placement of cabling and purchase of power supply etc.
!		HVCOR-02 is fine, the corrector after the collimator becomes HVCOR-03,
!		and we request an additional one after
!		the dipole between QUAD-05 and SCR-03, HVCOR-04 - intention is to get this as part
!		of fit of L02.
! 01/12/2015:	Removed 0.7 mm from each drift after S02-QUAD magnetic lengths to account
! 		for the increase of those from 100.0 mm to 100.7 mm
!
!V9.1
!
!		The purpose of this version is to implement some discrepancies that
!		arose when comparing V9 to the as-built CLARA Front End. This is mostly
!		due to some components having slightly different dimensions on installation
!		to that which was expected, some component redesigns, some alignment choices etc.
!
! 08/03/2016:	Redesign of screen mechanism for CLARA. See (Drg 256-12440
!  		at http://engregserve.dl.ac.uk and email dated 08/03/2016 "reference
!		drawing for clara screen mechanisms").
! 		The screen surface is not in the centre of the mechanism. The design is
!		such that the screen is perpendicular to the beam axis and it is the mirror
!		that is tilted to illuminate the camera. Optics is such that the screen
!		position is 16.667mm upstream from the reference point at the end of the
!		mechanism. 
! 08/03/2016: 	Stripline BPMs - the centre of the stripline is 100.7mm upstream of the
! 		reference point at the end of the flange. This info for orbit correction.
!		Reference for this is on the second page of the spreadsheet attached to
!		email from BF dated 04/03/2016
! 05/05/2016: 	Corrector yoke's are 30mm. Changing length of CLA-S01-MAG-HVCOR-01 accordingly
! 		and compensating with the (previously arbitrary) gun cavity length.
! 05/05/2015: 	CLA-S01-DIA-WCM-01 is 50mm rather than 100mm. Compensating by adding to (previously
! 		arbitrary lightbox length). Additional 0.7mm discrepancy also added.
! 05/05/2016:	Altered CLA-S01-DIA-SCR-01 to 120mm block length and shifted crystal surface
! 		upstream as note on 08/03 above.
! 05/05/2016:	Compensated for additional 8mm length of screen block by reducing length of
! 		CLA-L01-CAV-B. Then reduced by 0.7 to recover linac position
! 05/05/2016:	CLA-S02-DIA-BPM-01 moved to after CLA-S02-MAG-QUAD-01. CLA-S02-MAG-QUAD-01-A
! 		made zero length. BPM given 28.02mm length to effective end of coil (inside quad
!		in reality with length 210mm). BPM now given extra length as it protrudes
!		longer than the 28.02, compensating by reducing CLA-S02-DRIFT-01.
! 05/05/2016:	CLA-S02-DRIFT-02 - add 0.7mm discrepancy then reduce to fit in increased screen
! 		block length
! 05/05/2016:	CLA-S02-DIA-SCR-01 changed to screen 16.667 upstream		
! 05/05/2016: 	CLA-S02-DRIFT-04 reduced by 4mm to fit half of increase previous screen block length
! 05/05/2016:	0.7mm removed from CLA-S02-DRIFT-06 to realign.
! 05/05/2016: 	CLA-S02-DIA-BPM-02 moved to after CLA-S02-MAG-QUAD-05. In reality inside quad.
! 		Length altered such that end flange is correct
! 05/05/2016:	Reduced length of CLA-S02-MAG-HVCOR-04 to compensate for above. And again 2.87mm
! 		discrepancy to SCR-03. And again to account for the 4mm from increasing screen
!		mechanism after from 112 to 120.
! 06/05/2016:	Corrected and added quads in EBT spectrometer. N.B some of the drifts are guessed
! 		as i couldn't find a relevant engineering drawing and have had no word from Clive on the
!		shortened length of this
! 06/05/2016:	Added two quads in CLA-SP2. Also ensured first screen at same path length as S06.
!  		Reversed direction.
! 06/05/2016:	Added two quads in CLA-SP3. Also ensured first screen at same path length as S07.
!  		Reversed direction.
! 06/05/2016:	Added two quads in CLA-SP4. Also ensured first screen at same path length as PFD.
! 		Reversed direction.
! 06/05/2016: 	Aperture of X-band structure is minimum 8.239 mm not 9 mm (that is the average). Changed.
!
!V10
! 23/05/2016:	Corrected screen sizes and position in S06.
! 		At request of FEL group, reduced length of S06 and removed 2 quads.
!		L04 therefore shifted upstream by ~2 m to give more room for FEL.
!		Inserted additional quad at start of S07 to ensure
!		better match to TDC. Position and number of BPMs and correctors in
!		S06, SP2, S07, SP3, SLD and FMS revised. Added EOM electro-optic monitor diagnostic
!		placeholder.
!
! 24/06/2016:	Added S07 collimator, left 0.5m as we are unsure of the pipe aperture at present.
! 27/06/2016:	Added ICT's. Assumed 65 mm length as per VELA module 4 drawing 0256-0010075
! NOTE ADDED 19/09/2016: This reference is incorrect. ICT is on VELA module 3 and is 40mmm long.
! 27/06/2016: 	Added HVCORs in laser heater section (part of S04)
! 27/06/2016: 	Increased laser heater modulator undulator length from 0.5m to 0.715m based on
! 		information from NRT and presentation in email with this date.
!		This has increased the entire machine length by this amount.
! 28/06/2016: 	Extra BPM added in S07 after TDC - James recommended to lower vertical emit blowup
!
!V10.1
!
!		The purpose of this version is to implement information on real elements from
!		that were not known previously, some design changes and addition of constraints
!		due to vacuum valve placement
!
! 19/09/2016:	HVCORs are 25+50+25. Change implemented on S03 to S07
! 19/09/2016:	Inserted drifts in S03 to account for flanges / studs and L03 flanges.
! 19/09/2016:	ICT lengths are 40mm or 76.5 with 2 flanges. Corrected.
! 20/09/2016:	Ensured all quads in S04 have coil stand offs of 35mm each side to give
! 		total length 220 - readjusted drifts to compensate
! 07/10/2016:	Inserted EBT-INJ-DIA-SCR-05 - reference email from Deepa dated 03/10/2016
! 07/10/2016: 	Corrected CLA-SP1 length according to dearwing 256-10174
! 17/10/2016: 	Revised EBT-BA1 layout inserted. Refer to drawings 256-12870-B and 256-10160-C.
! 		Some of the dimensions are guessed as cannot ascertain from the drawings.
!		Wait for Barry to flag these
! 17/10/2016:	Implemented gun naming convention
! 19/01/2017:	Inserted additional corrector in S07 just prior to SP3
! 19/01/2017:	Decide to make laser heater undulator section symmetric. This involves inserting BPM
! 		before the undulator. This will be inside the corrector. Therefore this section length
!		increases by 210-100=110mm. The DIP-03 and -04 move downstream by this amount. In order
!		to not move any quads, we remove BPM-04 (but insert a drift of length 100mm). The BPM
!		is then reinserted between QUAD-06 and QUAD-07, where there is a space.
!		See laser heater report.
! 19/01/2017:	Increase to 90 cells the 4hc giving correct active length of 750mm. Issue to be resolved
! 		with placement of BPM 
! 31/01/2017:	S06 ICT removed as agreed with DAK / JKJ
! 31/01/2017: 	needed to shorten CLA-S05-DIA-SCR-01-A from 76.667 to 70
! 31/01/2017:	Inserted TDC dimensions from CLARA TDC mechanical requirements spec.
! 		Flange-flange is 720, active 450
! 20/03/2017: 	NRT says the radiator undulators wiggle in the vertical plane! Altered
! 23/03/2017:   Inserting VELA before the C2V-MAG-DIP-02 dipole such that we can generate all trajectories 
!
