# INSTRUCTIONS:
# Add loops in (prerferably in order!) by copy and pasting # an existing loop and adding it on the end, e.g.
# Loop_X
#
# QUAD01: A
# QUAD02: B
# QUAD03: C
# QUAD04: D
# QUAD05: E
# DIP02: F
#
# LLRF_Amplitude: G (MV/m)
# LLRF_Phase: H (degrees)
#
# LASER_HPos: I
# LASER_VPos: J
# LASER_Intensity: K
#
# Feel free to add whatevery magnets you'd like to use
#
# Please make sure that values for the same variables are
# given in each loop, even if they dont change!
